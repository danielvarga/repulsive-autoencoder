Check how training an EM NAT improves the separability of celeba images
Take 70% of the latent points, fit a logreg model to predict the labels of the corresponding images.
Use the remaining 30% to test prediction accuracy

Prediction accuracty does not change at all during training for most of the features.
For earthmover_celeba, these features improved somewhat
    (Attractive 51 -> 59, Heavy Makeup 61 -> 63, Smiling 51 -> 55, Wearing Lipstick 51 -> 58)

For earthmover_celeba_dim10, some futher features improved a bit, but the big picture is the same 
    (Attractive 51 -> 61, Heavy Makeup 61 -> 65, Smiling 51 -> 58, Wearing Lipstick 51 -> 63, High Cheek Bones 61 -> 65, Male 58 -> 61, Mouth Slightly Open 51 -> 54)
    Horrible generated-reconstructed images!!!

For earthmove_celeba_ornstein95, nothing but Male changed (dropped!)
    (Male 58 -> 50)
    Horrible generated-reconstructed images!!!
