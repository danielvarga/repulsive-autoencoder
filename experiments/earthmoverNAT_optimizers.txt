If we use sgd optimizer, the best setup uses high momentum hyperparameter (0.6) and extremely high learning rate (10)
If we replace sgd with adam optimizer, we can revert to its default learning rate (0.001) and obtain the same results.
We get the same results with rmsprop and its default learning rate (0.001)

However, out of these three, sgd optimizer runs faster
