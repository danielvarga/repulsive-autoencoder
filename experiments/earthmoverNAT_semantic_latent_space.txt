In earthmover_celeba_dim40_labels, the latent space is the 40 labels that we have for the celeba dataset. The latent point - image matching does not change during training.
In earthmover_celeba_dim40, everything is the same, but the latent points are generated from standard normal distribution and points are rematched in each batch

The aim of this experiment was to see if a handcrafted, semantically meaningful latent structure helps in the reconstruction task.
It seems that it does not, earthmover_celeba_dim40 achieves much greater reconstruction loss.
