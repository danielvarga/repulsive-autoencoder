earthmover_celeba_greedy_vaelatent uses as latent points the latent means of a trained vae.
earthmover_celeba_greedy_vaelatent2 uses as latent points the sampled latent points of a trained vae.
earthmover_celeba_greedy_vaelatent3 is just like earthmover_celeba_greedy_vaelatent2, but freezes the rematching for the first 10 epoch.

Using the latent structure of a trained VAE results in much better
reconstruction. If we take the latent means, then reconstruction
slightly improves, despite the fact that the means expand only a small
(20-25dim) submanifold of the latent space (200dim).

If we take the sampled latent structure, which is close to standard
normal, then reconstruction drastically improves, suggesting that the
way VAE-s arrange their latent points is useful for a reconstruction
task.

If we fix the matching for the first 10 epoch, then there is no more
rematching later on (fixedpointratio is practically 100%). In this
scenario we obtain even better reconstruction, with the same
generation quality. This suggests that we are better off staying with
the initial VAE structure, dispite some small gains due to partial
rearrangement.

Can we demonstrate the usefulness of the VAE latent structure on a
task that is not reconstruction related???
